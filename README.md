# Beigepaper 
A rewrite of the Yellowpaper in non-Yellowpaper syntax.

This project exists to make the [Ethereum Yellowpaper](http://gavwood.com/paper.pdf) readable by a broader audience. This is a beta release, so errata exist, and certain content still needs to be added. 

A fully compiled version of the Beigepaper exists in the main directory of this repository.

###Build Instructions
