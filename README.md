[Latest Release](https://github.com/chronaeon/beigepaper/blob/master/beigepaper.pdf)

# Beigepaper 
A rewrite of the Yellowpaper in non-Yellowpaper syntax.

This project exists to make the [Ethereum Yellowpaper](http://gavwood.com/paper.pdf) readable by a broader audience. This is a beta release, so errata exist, and content is still being added.


### Build Instructions
